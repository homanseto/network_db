### 3D Indoor Network shapefile example

3D Indoor Network.shp → Geometry
3D Indoor Network.shx → Geometry index
3D Indoor Network.dbf → Attribute table
3D Indoor Network.prj → Projection
3D Indoor Network.cpg → Encoding

GDAL treats all of these as ONE dataset.

A Feature ID (FID) is a unique identifier assigned to each feature (e.g., a row in a shapefile or a record in a database table) in a geospatial dataset.
